# Password-Generator
I created the password generator because I wanted to add this to my resume to show future employers what I am capable of doing. Overall, this project was really fun and it took me 2 1/2 weeks to finish. 
How it works: click the checkboxes to show how many characters you want selected and then from there click generate password and you will have a generated password.
